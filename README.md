The Python script I used to add a copyright notice to every .java source file when I open sourced the [Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 Replay Manager](https://github.com/TinusTinus/replaymanager).

It's a very simple script, but with some modifications it might come in handy in the future, so I thought I'd put it up on Github.
